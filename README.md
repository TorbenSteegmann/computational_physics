# Computational Physics

This repository showcases a selection of work from the Computational Physics course at RWTH Aachen University.

Please note that graph plotting is implemented using a C++ wrapper for Matplotlib. To run the programs, youâ€™ll need to link both the Python library and the appropriate include directory in your CMakeLists.txt file. Due to this dependency on Matplotlib, you may encounter issues during initial compilation. However, re-compiling should resolve these problems.
